# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the deep learning technique to perform image classification. In this paper, we compared two model CNN find the best model CNN to classify tumours in Brain MRI Image and at the end, we have trained CNN and obtained a prediction accuracy of up to 99.99%.
